# OpenSimRL Documentation

Welcome to the OpenSimRL documentation! This framework provides tools for running large-scale, distributed reinforcement learning simulations.

## Features
- Modular architecture for pluggable RL environments & algorithms
- Support for cutting-edge algorithms (PPO, SAC, Dreamer, etc.)
- Distributed rollout collection and training
- Experiment logging and visualization
- Kubernetes/Argo/Ray orchestration

## Getting Started
To install OpenSimRL:
```bash
pip install opensimrl
```

Check out our [tutorials](tutorials.md) for examples of training agents on various environments.
